# Web-Scraper
This is a very much in-the-works web scraper that I made for eBay. I used ThinkPad laptops as the item I was searching for. This scraper prints the name of the item, its price, and shipping costs. In the future, I want to add those criteria to a pandas dataframe for better organization.
